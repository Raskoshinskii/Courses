    "### What is a Dependency?\n",
    "Dependency refers to a package or module that another piece of code relies on. Dependencies are typically specified in a project's configuration file:\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`\n",
    "- `pyproject.toml`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install or run the project, the dependency manager (e.g. `pip`, `Poetry`) resolves these dependencies, ensuring that the required packages are installed and available for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between requirements.txt and pyproject.toml**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these files are used for specifying project dependencies and configuration but they serve different purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "`requirements.txt:`\n",
    "- Always is a text file\n",
    "- Format: plain text\n",
    "- Package manager: pip\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyproject.toml:`\n",
    "- Always TOML format\n",
    "- Format: more human-readable and allows for more complex configurations\n",
    "- Package manager: Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` to define environment for production and development. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**List of Dependencies Managers**\n",
    "- `pip`: default package manager for Python\n",
    "- `Poetry`: modern dependency manager for Python\n",
    "- `conda`: package and env manager for Python\n",
    "- `pipenv`: combines pip and virtualenv\n",

    "### What is Poetry?\n",
    "It's a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It's better than `pip` because it simplifies the process of managing:\n",
    "- project dependencies\n",
    "- virtual environments\n",
    "- packaging Python projects and distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Dependencies management`:\n",
    "-   Dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml` file. It automatically resolves dependencies, installs them in the correct versions and generates a lock file: `poetry.lock` to ensure reproducible builds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Virtual Environments`:\n",
    "- Poetry creates and manages virtual environments for each project. This helps isolate project dependencies from system-wide installations and ensures consistent development environments across different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Packaging`:\n",
    "- Poetry can package Python projects into distributable formats such as wheels or source distributions. It generates a `setup.py` file based on the project's configuration, making it easy to distribute projects via PyPI or other package repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Dependency Resolution`\n",
    "- Poetry **uses a robust dependency resolver** to ensure that project dependencies are compatible and resolve conflicts. It considers constraints and compatibility markers to find the best version of each dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Script Execution`\n",
    "- Poetry allows you to define scripts in the `pyproject.toml` file, making it easy to define and run custom commands or scripts associated with your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Poetry aims to provide a simple, consistent, and modern solution for managing Python projects and dependencies, making it easier for developers to create, manage, and distribute Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using Poetry\n",
    "- No plain text anymore (`requirements.txt`). Shows dependency tree for the used libraries.\n",
    "- Can delete a package and its dependencies to maintain clean environment\n",
    "- No need to define two env files (e.g. `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`)\n",
    "- Once a package is installed, it automatically apperas in `pyproject.toml` (no need for manual update)\n",
    "- Dependecy tree can be easily visualised: `poetry show --tree`\n",
    "- Can easily check for new packages versions: `poetry show --latest`\n",
    "- Dependencies are locked using `poetry.lock`\n",
    "- Scripts can be defined in `pyproject.toml` (e.g. add new section `[tools.poetry.scripts]` and define logic)\n",

    "### Poetry Installation\n",
    "Check official website:\n",
    "- https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Poetry Example\n",
    "Poetry can be initialized in two ways:\n",
    "1. Using existing project\n",
    "2. From scratch -> poetry creates project structure\n",
    "    - `poetry new <project_dir_name>`\n",
    "    - `tree` -> look at poetry generated project tree \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a new project dir using poetry and look at generated tree. Create new dir,  assume that this is a dir for our future project:\n",
    "1. Initialize Poetry in `my_project`\n",
    "    - `poetry init`\n",
    "2. After poetry initialization we have `pyproject.toml` file, configuration file.\n",
    "3. Install `requests` using poetry\n",
    "    - `poetry add requests`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Poetry and Virtual Env\n",
    "We can manage virtual envs using Poetry. Let's create a new virtual env in one of our playground projects:\n",
    "- `poetry env use <python_version>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Obrained virtual env is stored not in current dir but in `/home/vlad/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/`. To activate poetry venv, run:\n",
    "- `poetry shell`\n",
    "- `exit` -> exit from poetry venv\n",
    "\n",
    "Once venv is created we **can run executable files from venv without activating it**:\n",
    "- `poetry run <executable_file_name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "To show info about current venv, run:\n",
    "- `poetry env info`"
