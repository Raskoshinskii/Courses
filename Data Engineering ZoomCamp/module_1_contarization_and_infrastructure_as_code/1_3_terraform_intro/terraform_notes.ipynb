    "### Terraform Intro\n",
    "Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language. You can manage and automate the deployment:\n",
    "- cloud infrastructure\n",
    "- on-premises infrastructure\n",
    "- services across a variety of providers(AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of Terraform -> achieve infrastructure automation, consistency and scalability. IaC -> make resources using code files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terraform Key Features\n",
    "1. Declarative Configuration:\n",
    "    - Terraform uses a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language `(HCL)` to **define infrastructure resources and their dependencies.** This allows you to describe the desired state of your infrastructure without specifying the step-by-step process to achieve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform treats infrastructure as code, allowing\n",
    "    - version-control your infrastructure configurations\n",
    "    - collaborate with team members (Version Control)\n",
    "    - automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources using code\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provider-agnostic:\n",
    "    - Terraform supports a wide range of infrastructure providers, including public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), private cloud platforms (VMware, OpenStack), and software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers (GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes). This enables you to manage multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments using a single tool\n",
    "\n",
    "4. State Management:\n",
    "    - Terraform maintains a state file that tracks the current state of your infrastructure and the relationships between resources. This state file is used to plan and execute changes to your infrastructure, ensuring that only the necessary changes are applied and that your infrastructure remains consistent with your configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Execution Plans:\n",
    "    - Terraform generates execution plans (terraform plan) that show the actions it will take to modify your infrastructure to match the desired state specified in your configuration. This allows you to review proposed changes before applying them to your infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Resource Graph:\n",
    "    - Terraform builds a dependency graph of your infrastructure resources based on their configurations and relationships. This enables Terraform to determine the order in which resources should be created, updated, or destroyed to maintain consistency and avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Terraform Cannot Do\n",
    "- no infrastructure managing and updating\n",
    "- cannot change immutable resources (type of VM)\n",
    "- resources that are not defined in a terraform file"

    "### How Terraform Works\n",
    "Let's assume that we've built a software locally and we would like to run this software in a cloud using a certain provider.\n",
    "To do this we can install terraform and define configuration for any provider that must be used to run our software. \n",

    "### Key Terraform Commands\n",
    "- `init`: get providers that I need\n",
    "- `plan`: shows the resources that will be created\n",
    "- `apply`: do what in terraform files (.tf) is defined\n",
    "- `destroy`: remove everything defined in terraform files\n",
    "- `fmt`: formats the code according to terrafrom standards\n",
    "- `init`: get the provider (piece of code to talk with provider (e.g. GCP, AWS, ...))\n",

    "### Terraform Installation / WSL\n",
    "1. Visit Terraform site: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install#Linux\n",
    "2. Copy link of a `Binary Download`\n",
    "3. Open WSL and run `wget <terraform_release_link>`\n",
    "4. Put terraform into `$PATH`:\n",
    "    - `sudo unzip <terraform_version>.zip -d /usr/local/bin`\n",
    "5. Confirm installation: `terraform -version`\n",

    "1. Create GCP account and service account\n",
    "2. Follow the steps on the video to set up GCP service account\n",
